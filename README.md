The [ha_cyberq] integration is used to integrate the [BBQ
Guru][bbq_guru] CyberQ Cloud and CyberQ WiFi automatic BBQ temperature controllers.

The BBQ Guru CyberQ Cloud and WiFi are discontinued products.
Information about these controllers can be found on the [BBQ Guru
Support Pages][bbq_guru_support]

This integration aims to enable complete control of these temperature
controllers as well as replace the need for the BBQ Guru Cloud.

## Installation

### The easy way

Add this repository to your HACS with the following button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jchonig&repository=ha_cyberq&category=integration)

Install this integration with the following button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=cyberq)

### Manual installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `cyberq`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/cyberq/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and
   search for "CyberQ"

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the instructions for your device found on the [BBQ Guru
Support Pages][bbq_guru_support] to connect your device to your WiFi
network in Infrastructure Mode.
1. Make note of the IP address and port number (defaults to 80) of
   your CyberQ.
1. If your CyberQ has a username and password configured (you are
   prompted to log in when you browse to it), have those credentials
   ready. They are optional and only needed if your device requires
   them.

> [!WARNING]
> The CyberQ only speaks plain HTTP, so it can only authenticate with
> HTTP Basic Auth. Your username and password are sent unencrypted on
> every poll — that is roughly every 5 seconds — and anyone able to
> observe traffic on your network can read them. Use a password unique
> to the CyberQ, never one you use anywhere else, and keep the device
> on a trusted network segment.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Data updates

This integration fetches data from the device every 5 seconds by
default.
The internal webserver of the CyberQ devices fetches data every 1
second, however HomeAssistant has a lower limit on the update
interval of 1 second.

## Notifications

Install the following blueprint to configure notifications from the
CyberQ

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjchonig%2Fha_cyberq%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcyberq_alert.yaml)

## Known limitations

See [Issues][issues]

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

After deleting the integration, go to the app of the manufacturer and remove the Home Assistant integration from there as well.
